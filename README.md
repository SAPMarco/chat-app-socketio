# Design and Build a Chat App with Socket.io

I was looking for some hands-on practice and saw [@christianp86](https://github.com/christianp86) starring this wonderful [project](https://github.com/jamesqquick/Design-and-Build-a-Chat-Application-with-Socket.io) of [James Q Quick](https://github.com/jamesqquick). So I followed it along and learned as well as refreshed a few things here and there. I've never been the CSS guy and I sometimes lack imagination in order to create something from scratch, so this was perfect. Not to mention the free tips on [emmet abbreviations](https://docs.emmet.io/abbreviations/) and [vsc code snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) Check out the YT-Playlist linked below!
